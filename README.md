This project was made through JS REACT and was used to make the website that showed real time data based on the city input.
4 important files:
1.APP.js
2.App.css
3.index.html
4.Weather.js

1. The app.js was the main file that connected the API key to the information layers using several function, variables, and included websites.
There was a lot of time that was spent modifying this app because of the different components that I had to get right which included the location
weather condition, and temperature. There was a lot of built in function that were used such as the handlesearch, app, fetch, json, and trim functions.
There were i statements that were set in order to show the user that there was an error in the input for the city. There were fetch statements 
used to retrieve weather and location. Overall this was a huge body of work.

2. The App.css was used to design the webapp with regards to the header, input, and other things. It helped decide the way the error message was 
going to look and how the corresponding weather details and location details looked. The search button was also coded by the CSS language. 

3. The index.html file was used to showcase the weather app title. The index.css styled the way it looked. 

4. The weather.js file showcases the tem, condition, and windspeed.
